## Main Objective

Provide a web application based solution to aid prosthetic and orthotic surgeons to automate the manual procedure of customizing diabetic shoe insoles by detecting and measuring the areas to cut holes and offload the insole accurately. Additionally, this applucation predicts the Diabetic Foot Ulcer's (DFU's) criticality automatically.

## Main Research questions

*  How to detect wound areas and measure the accurate areas to cut holes and identify new areas to re-distribute high pressure (pressure-offloading) in the insole of a diabetic shoe and predict DFU criticality automatically ?

## Individual research question

| Name | Research Question |
| ------ | ------ |
| U.S. Dahanayake | How to identify the wound areas in an accurate manner ? |
| P.A.D.N.I. Ariyasinghe | How to measure the areas to cut holes on the insole in an accurate manner ? / How to predict/asses DFU criticality? |
| S.A.K.S. Samarasinghe | How to get the measurements of high-pressure areas to re-distibute the pressure (pressure offloading) in an automated way ? |
| S.M.D.H. Samarakoon | How to identify the wound areas in an accurate manner ?How to identify the new pressure offloading areas ? |

## Individual Objectives

| Name | Research Question |
| ------ | ------ |
| U.S. Dahanayake | Identify wound areas by analysing the real sole images. |
| P.A.D.N.I. Ariyasinghe | Measure the identified wound areas to get the hole sizes in the insole. / Predict DFU criticality.|
| S.A.K.S. Samarasinghe | Identify and measure high-pressure areas (red colour areas) by using the scanned foot image. |
| S.M.D.H. Samarakoon | Analyze the two datasets containing real and scanned images of feet and identify new areas to re-distribute pressure (pressure offloading areas). |


## Other necessary information

**Datasets**
*  Foot images with wounds of diabetic patients dataset/ wound criticality dataset - Taken from Dr. Namarathe at Diabetic Footcare and Rehabilitation Center, Nawala 
*  Scanned foot images of diabetic patients dataset - Taken from Kings Hospital, Colombo
*  DFU severity prediction dataset - Generated using above two datasets
