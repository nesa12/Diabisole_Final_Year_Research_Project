# Diabisole_Final_Year_Research_Project

## Main Objective

Provide web application based solution to detect and measure the accurate areas to cut holes and offload the insole Diabetic Foot Ulcer's (DFU's) criticality automatically.

## Main Research questions

*  How to detect wound areas and measure the accurate areas to cut holes and identify new areas to re-distribute high pressure (pressure-offloading) in the insole of a diabetic shoe and predict DFU criticality automatically ?

## Individual Objectives

| IT Number | Name | Research Question |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| IT20043650 | Dahanayake U.S. | Identify wound areas by analysing the real sole images. |
| IT20033828 | Ariyasinghe P.A.D.N.I. | Measure the identified wound areas to get the hole sizes in the insole. / Predict wound criticality.|
| IT20206246 | Samarasinghe S.A.K.S. | Identify and measure high-pressure areas (red colour areas) by using the scanned foot image. |
| IT20457952 | Samarakoon S.M.D.H. | Analyze the two datasets containing real and scanned images of feet and identify new areas to re-distribute pressure (pressure offloading areas). |


## Other necessary information

**Datasets**
*  Foot images with wounds of diabetic patients dataset/ wound criticality dataset - Taken from Dr. Namarathe at Diabetic Footcare and Rehabilitation Center, Nawala 
*  Scanned foot images of diabetic patients dataset - Taken from Kings Hospital, Colombo
*  DFU severity prediction dataset - Generated using above two datasets
